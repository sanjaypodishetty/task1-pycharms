Let's assume Vipul is guessing a 2 digit number and the computer has already decided a number randomly between 01 to 99. If Vipul's guess is higher than the computer's decided number, print guess is high and if lower then print guess is low and if the guess is correct print guess is correct, and also print number of guesses required by Vipul to guess the number.
